<h2>EMERGENCE:<h2>
<p>Greeniverse emerged as a project made by group 1 of class 1 of .Net of the architect integrator project by the ong Generation Brasil.</p>
<h2>ABOUT OUR PROJECT:<h2>
<p>
We are an e-commerce focused on following the parameters of ODS 2 "Ending hunger, achieving food security and improving nutrition and promoting sustainable agriculture". In this way, we deliver a differential e-commerce to those present in the market given to their purpose of birth and their services provided.
That way, we deliver a product that dialogues directly with small and medium producers, which redirects donations made on the site to people in situations of food shortage and delivers quality organic products in an agile and ethical way. Consequently, we care about the whole process from harvest to delivery.
</p>
<h2>HOW DOES THE PLATFORM WORK?<h2>
<p>
The Greeniverse website makes the connection of small and medium producers to consumers (both individuals and legal entities) providing greater ease to those interested in buying organic products. The platform functions as an online market with a large distribution area, working in an agile and efficient way. In addition, producers can register directly on   the platform and will be evaluated by our administrative team, in addition we will redirect donations to ogs that take care of the problem of hunger and malnutrition.
